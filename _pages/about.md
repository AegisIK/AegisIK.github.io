My name is Kevin, and I'm currently a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor Amir Farimani. Previously, I worked at JPMorgan Chase's Commecial Bank AI team on LLMs as well as Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. There, I was fortunate enough to have worked with Professor [Gerbrand Ceder](https://ceder.berkeley.edu/) and [Bowen Deng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowen-deng-16390b264) on [CHGNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00716-3) and large scale inference for machine learning interatomic potentials (paper coming soon). 

My research interests lie primarily in using AI for materials and drug discovery and automated scientific discovery. I come primarily from a machine learning background as opposed to a chemistry or biology background. My research related experiences involve Pytorch, Cython, performance programming with C, and CUDA. 

I also enjoy general full stack software engineering and LLMs and have experience building large scale software systems for startups I've worked on in the past or for the [UC Berkeley EECS Department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

If you have any questions regarding Berkeley, CMU, finding internships/research, or general life stuff, feel free to email me! My email can be found on the sidebar.
